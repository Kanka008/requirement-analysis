## Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified, documented, and analyzed before any actual development begins. The goal is to ensure that the software system will meet the intended purpose and solve the right problems, reducing misunderstandings and costly changes later in the process.

In this assignment, we are expected to:

* Define Requirement Analysis and understand its role in software projects.

* Explore the importance of requirement analysis in delivering successful solutions.

* Identify and describe the key activities involved in the requirement analysis process.

* Understand the types of requirements, including functional, non-functional, business, and user requirements.

While our main ALX project involves building an AirBnB-like platform, this repository focuses specifically on the theory and practice of requirement analysis as a standalone exercise in professional software engineering.



## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) during which the project team works closely with stakeholders to gather, interpret, and define the software system's requirements. This involves identifying what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements).

The main goal of this phase is to ensure that all parties involved—developers, clients, users, and project managers—have a shared understanding of the software’s purpose, features, and constraints. By doing so, the development team can avoid misunderstandings and misaligned expectations that often lead to failed or delayed projects.
